## ðŸŒŸTheme and Inspiration
For the theme of my portfolio, I wanted something clean,simple,and a bit natural.
I chose these main color:
- #8db95b - a soft green that feels fresh and peaceful.
- #27ae60 - a brighter green that adds energy and life to the design.
- #f5f5dc - a light beige background that keeps everything easy to read and not too bright.
I was inspired by nature and calm colors. I didn't want the website to look too dark or too busy. I tried to make it feel friendly and professional at the same time,using colors that show a bit of my personality.

##ðŸ’¡Design Decisions
I built the whole website using only HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript. The layout is fully responsive, so it works well on phones, tablets, and desktops.
I added 4 main sections:
**Home**
**About Me**
**Portfolio**
**Contact Me**
I used a sticky navigation bar , so users can easily move between sections.
I used hover effects and transitions with css to make the design a little more fun and interactive.
I tried to keep everything simple, clean and easy to use.

##ðŸš§ Challenges
Makingeverything look good on both small and large screens was a bit hard at first, but I learned to use flexbox, gridlayouts to fix it.
Since I couldn't use bootstrap or javascript, I had to be creative with CSS only to make the layout and design work the way I wanted.
Picking the right colors and font sizes that looked good together also took time, but I'm happy with the result.

##âœ… Final thoughts
This project helped me practice and improve my HTML and CSS skills.
I learned how to make a website that looks good on different devices, how to choose colors and layouts, and how to stay creative while working with simple tools.
I'm proud of how it turned out and excited to keep learning more.
